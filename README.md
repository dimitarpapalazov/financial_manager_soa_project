# financial_manager_soa_project
This is a project with microservices I created for purposes for the course I studied named "Service-oriented Architecture". I learned to implement that architecture as microservices using Python with Flask as framework. The project was inspired by a project I did for other subject in the past. It consist of 6 microservices, using Consul as service discovery tool.
